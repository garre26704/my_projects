# 3d RENDERER.PY:
is a program for rendering three-dimensional models written entirely in python. The program uses a python script to extract the model data (vertices, connections) from blender; so to run the program you will need to install the bpy blender api. Furthermore, to simplify the code I used a library based on pygame that I've created (GameRex.py). This library is used to implement the pygame functions pygame.draw_poly() and pygame.draw_segment() ; I've also used numpy to manipulate matrices and arrays. The rest of the code was written by me.
